    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Mayerling Joseph, a Junior Software Engineer with a deep
      passion for technology and problem-solving. However, my journey into the
      tech world is not a typical one. I began my career as a special education
      teacher, a role that taught me patience, empathy, and the ability to break
      down complex concepts into understandable parts. While I loved my work, I
      was always intrigued by the technological tools I used daily. The
      potential of technology to transform education and the world at large was
      fascinating, and I found myself drawn to the process of creating such
      tools. With that spark of interest, I decided to transition to software
      engineering. I immersed myself in learning coding languages, understanding
      algorithms, and building functional applications. The process was
      challenging, but every problem I solved and every project I built
      increased my fascination and love for this field. Now, as a software
      engineer, I combine my teaching skills and technical skills to develop
      applications that are not only functional but also intuitive and
      user-friendly. My journey from special education to software engineering
      has been unique, but I believe it's this unique path that has equipped me
      with the tools to make a difference in the tech world.
